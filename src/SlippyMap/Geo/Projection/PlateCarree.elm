module SlippyMap.Geo.Projection.PlateCarree exposing (project, projection, unproject)

{-| Equirectangular, or Plate Carree projection â€” the most simple projection, mostly used by GIS enthusiasts. Directly maps `x` as longitude, and `y` as latitude. Also suitable for flat worlds, e.g. game maps. Used by the `EPSG:4326` and `Simple` CRS.
